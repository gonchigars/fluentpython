Day 1: Introduction & Python Data Model (Chapters 1-3)

Morning: Read Chapter 1: The Python Data Model. This chapter sets the foundation by explaining special methods, which are key to understanding how Python objects interact with built-in language features.

Afternoon: Cover Chapter 2: Sequences to understand the built-in sequence types (lists, tuples, etc.). Practice using slicing and list comprehensions.

Evening: Go through Chapter 3: Dictionaries and Sets. Practice implementing dictionaries and understanding their key features.

Day 2: Functions as Objects (Chapters 7-8)

Morning: Read Chapter 7: Functions as First-Class Objects. Explore how Python functions can be passed around, assigned to variables, and even returned from other functions.

Afternoon: Dive into Chapter 8: Type Hints in Functions to learn about using type hints for clearer and more robust code.

Evening: Practice by creating a few functions that use decorators and closures, and experiment with adding type hints.

Day 3: Data Structures Deep Dive (Chapters 4-6)

Morning: Cover Chapter 4: Unicode Text Versus Bytes to understand text handling and encoding/decoding in Python.

Afternoon: Read Chapter 5: Data Class Builders to learn about @dataclass and creating clean, readable classes.

Evening: Finish with Chapter 6: Object References, Mutability, and Recycling. Explore concepts like shallow and deep copying to understand how Python handles memory.

Day 4: Object-Oriented Python (Chapters 11-13)

Morning: Go through Chapter 11: A Pythonic Object to learn about creating well-behaved Python objects with attributes and methods.

Afternoon: Read Chapter 12: Special Methods for Sequences to understand how to make your custom objects behave like Python sequences.

Evening: Dive into Chapter 13: Interfaces, Protocols, and ABCs to learn about abstract base classes and how they help with code reusability.

Day 5: Decorators, Closures & Metaprogramming (Chapters 9-10, 22-24)

Morning: Read Chapter 9: Decorators and Closures. Practice building simple decorators.

Afternoon: Cover Chapter 10: Design Patterns with First-Class Functions to understand how Python's first-class functions enable design flexibility.

Evening: Begin Chapter 22: Dynamic Attributes and Properties for insights into Python's metaprogramming capabilities.

Day 6: Iterators, Generators & Concurrency (Chapters 17-19)

Morning: Read Chapter 17: Iterators, Generators, and Classic Coroutines to understand lazy iteration and how generators work.

Afternoon: Move on to Chapter 18: with, match, and else Blocks for a deeper understanding of control flow.

Evening: Begin Chapter 19: Concurrency Models in Python to understand threading, multiprocessing, and the GIL.

Day 7: Practice Day & Recap

Morning: Review your notes and the key concepts from the chapters you read during the week.

Afternoon: Pick some exercises from the book and implement what you've learned, focusing on data models, decorators, and iterators.

Evening: Reflect on the material, make a list of topics you'd like to explore further, and draft a study plan for in-depth reading for the next few weeks.
